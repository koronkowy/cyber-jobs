cyber-jobs
========

This is a cute little collection of companies easily paired with the careers pages of those respective companies. These companies might be tech companies broadly (tagged as such), recruiting companies, nonprofits, defence companies, and or meet multiple categorizations. You can search if you want to quickly see a company on the list.

How To Submit
===============

Feel free to create issues with companies that I should put on here, better yet if you link me to the careers page so it's easy.

Future
===============

I want to automate this from my Google Sheets page so this is easier to maintain, maybe. Or streamline submissions.
